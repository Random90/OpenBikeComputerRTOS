# OpenBikeComputerRTOS
This repo is an idea for open source bike computer based on freeRTOS on ESP8266.
First commits will be my attempts of learning C and freeRTOS env. I've first made bike computer using arduino nano, so this might be refered as version 2.

Core functionality will consist of basic speed measures, distance, cadence.

For starters it will support Nokia 5110 LCD display. Good for day and night conditions.

Additional funcionality would be syncing data with python flask server using WiFi,
sync with Strava API, Wifi geolocation.
Even later in future: GPS module, GPRS module for live tracking. 

Also, I plan to make an 3dprint ready project for this bike computer.

Core intensions for making all this is learning new things like freeRTOS, python or creating objects for 3dprinting.
Creating community around this project for all programmers riding their bikes would be awesome :)
